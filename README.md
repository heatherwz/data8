# data8
Projects from my data science course
In project 2, I did the following:
Tested whether observed data appears to be a random sample from a distribution
Analyzed a natural experiment
Implemented and interpreted a sign test
Created a function to run a general hypothesis test
Analyzed visualizations and draw conclusions from them

In project 3, I built a k-nearest-neighbors classifier and tested the classifier on data.
