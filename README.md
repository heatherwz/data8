# data8
These are some projects from the data science course I took.

In project 2, I did the following:
Tested whether observed data appears to be a random sample from a distribution,
Analyzed a natural experiment,
Implemented and interpreted a sign test,
Created a function to run a general hypothesis test, and
Analyzed visualizations and draw conclusions from them.

In project 3, I built a k-nearest-neighbors classifier and tested the classifier on data.
